# Assignment 5 - RentNest Frontend 🏠
**"Find & List Rental Properties with Ease"**

---

## Project Overview

RentNest is a modern, responsive **Next.js application** for a rental property marketplace. Landlords can list properties, manage availability, and approve or reject rental requests via an intuitive dashboard. Tenants can browse listings with advanced filtering, submit rental requests, and complete secure payments. Admins oversee the entire platform through a comprehensive moderation dashboard. 

> 💡 **Note**: This is a **frontend-only** assignment. You will consume a backend API (your own from a previous assignment).

> ⚠️ Note: Consider these requirements as a starting guide. Modify, add, or prune features to align with your implementation strategy.

## Roles & Permissions

| Role | Description | Frontend UI Expectations |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tenant** | Users looking for rental properties | Public browsing, interactive request forms, payment checkout flow, review submission, protected tenant dashboard. |
| **Landlord** | Property owners who list rentals | Protected landlord dashboard, property CRUD forms (with image upload UI), request approval/rejection toggles, tenant history views. |
| **Admin** | Platform moderators | Protected admin dashboard, user management tables (ban/unban actions), global platform statistics, content moderation UI. |

> 💡 **Note**: Users select their role during registration. The UI must dynamically adapt based on the authenticated user's role, and routes must be protected using **Next.js Middleware**.

## Flow Diagrams & UI Considerations

### 🏠 Tenant Journey
```text
[Register/Login] → [Browse Properties] → [View Details] 
       ↓
[Submit Request Form (Validation)] → [Wait for Approval UI]
       ↓
[Approved: "Pay Now" CTA] → [Stripe/SSLCommerz Redirect]
       ↓
[Payment Success Page] → [Leave Review Form]
```
> **UI Focus**: Show loading spinners during form submission. Use toast notifications for success/failure.

### 🏘️ Landlord Journey
```text
[Register/Login] → [Dashboard Overview] → [Create Listing Form]
       ↓
[View Incoming Requests Table] → [Click Approve/Reject]
       ↓
[Toast Notification: "Request Approved"] → [Tenant can now pay]
```
> **UI Focus**: Use optimistic UI updates to instantly reflect status changes in the table without a full page reload.

### 📊 Rental Request Status (UI Badges)
- `PENDING` → Yellow/Orange Badge
- `APPROVED` → Blue Badge (Shows "Pay Now" button)
