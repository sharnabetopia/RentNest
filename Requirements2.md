⚠️ Mandatory Requirements
Caution

MANDATORY - READ CAREFULLY

The following SIX requirements are MANDATORY:

API Integration & Documentation - Consume all required backend endpoints. Provide a brief API_INTEGRATION.md file mapping frontend components to backend endpoints.
Consistent UI Error Handling - All API errors must show user-friendly, structured UI feedback (e.g., Toast notifications, inline form errors, Error Boundaries).
Commits - 20 meaningful frontend commits with descriptive messages (e.g., feat: add role-based dashboard layout, fix: resolve stripe checkout redirect loop).
Admin Credentials - Provide working admin email & password to test the deployed frontend application.
Payment Integration - Must integrate the frontend flow for Stripe (Checkout/Elements) or SSLCommerz. Simulated/fake payments (Cash on Delivery, Pay Later) are NOT accepted. Must handle success/cancel redirect pages.
❌ Failure to complete any of these = 0 MARKS

What to Cover:

Project overview & Next.js architecture (App Router, folder structure).
Demonstrate all 3 roles working via the actual UI (Customer/Tenant, Provider/Landlord/Technician, Admin). Show how the UI adapts per role.
Show CRUD operations via the UI (e.g., creating an item, updating status, deleting).
Demonstrate validation (show an error triggering) and error handling (e.g., network error toast).
Walk through the Payment Integration flow (from clicking "Pay" to the success page).
Briefly explain one technical challenge you solved (e.g., middleware auth, state management, payment webhook handling).
Recording Options:

Loom - Record & share link directly.
OBS - Record & upload to Google Drive (set "Anyone with link" access).
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend
Technology	Purpose
Next.js (App Router)	React Framework, Routing, Server Components
TypeScript	Type safety (Mandatory)
Tailwind CSS	Styling (Shadcn UI, DaisyUI, or custom components allowed)
Fetch, TanStack Query (React Query) or SWR	Server state management and data fetching
Auth.js or Custom JWT Middleware	Authentication and protected routes
Stripe.js or SSLCommerz JS	Frontend payment gateway integration
Deployment
Service	Purpose
Vercel/Render	Frontend application deployment (Recommended)
🎯 Key Rules
Roles: Each project has 3 fixed roles. The UI must dynamically render navigation, dashboards, and actions based on the authenticated user's role. Use Next.js Middleware for route protection.
Payment: Payment integration is MANDATORY. The frontend must successfully initiate the payment (e.g., redirect to Stripe Checkout or SSLCommerz gateway) and handle the return URL (success/cancel pages) gracefully, updating the UI accordingly.
Backend Dependency: You may connect to your own backend from a previous assignment, a partner's backend, or a provided mock backend. If using a mock, document it clearly, but real API integration is highly preferred.
Performance: Optimize images using next/image, implement loading states (loading.tsx), and handle errors gracefully (error.tsx).
⚠️ Important Notes
Plagiarism = 0 Marks. All UI components, logic, and integrations must be your original work. Using AI to generate entire pages without understanding or customization will result in mark deduction.

Good luck! Build a blazing-fast, beautiful, and robust Next.js frontend you're proud of. 🚀
